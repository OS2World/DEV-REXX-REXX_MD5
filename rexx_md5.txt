       Short Description: REXX callable procedures for computing MD4 and MD5 digests

        Long Description: 
 REXX_MD5 contains several OS/2 REXX tools that allow you to compute
 the MD4 and MD5 digest of any string. Included are "all REXX" procedures
 for computing MD4 and MD5 digests, and a "REXX callable DLL" that
 contains procedures for computing MD4 and MD5 digests. 
 Although the "all REXX"  procedures are easier to work with (they
 are text files suitable for inclusion in your own REXX code),
 they are MUCH slower then the "dll" versions.
